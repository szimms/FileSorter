# FileSorter
A simple program to sort my downloads folder.

I use python to sort the files in downloads folder.

I sort this folder by file type and place them into their respective folders. 
If there is a repeat file(one in downloads folder and one in destination) it will skip that file and I will manually take care of it, this is done by choice
